# Welcome to Trybers & Dragons!

In this mini RPG-inspired adventure, players fight each other or face dangerous monsters and dragons. Although the user can't directly control the fighting, the outcomes are always random and it is possible to tweak some parameters in the `index.ts` file, like the player's race or level.

The aim of this project was to practice Object Oriented Programming and SOLID principles - this was my first major attempt at this programming paradigm.

This project was developed while studying Back-end web development [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe). The files I worked on are in the /src folder. I got approval on 100% of this project's requirements.

The randomization of battles and the 'announcements' were not required, I did them just for fun :)

## Main languages and tools used

- Typescript
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID
- Docker
